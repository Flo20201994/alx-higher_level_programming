0. Squared simple
Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.

Prototype: def square matrix simple(matrix=[]):
matrix is a 2 dimensional array

my list is the initial list
search is the element to replace in the list
replace is the new element
You are not allowed to import any module

2. Unique addition
mandatory
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)

5. Number of keys
Write a function that returns the number of keys in a dictionary.

Prototype: def number keys(a dictionary):
You are not allowed to import any module

6. Print sorted dictionary

Write a function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys.

Prototype: def print sorted dictionary(a dictionary):
You can assume that all keys are strings
Keys should be sorted by alphabetic order
Only sort keys of the first level (don’t sort keys of a dictionary inside the main dictionary)
Dictionary values can have any type
You are not allowed to import any module

7. Update dictionary

Write a function that replaces or adds key/value in a dictionary.

Prototype: def update dictionary(a dictionary, key, value):
key argument will be always a string
value argument will be any type
If a key exists in the dictionary, the value will be replaced
If a key doesn’t exist in the dictionary, it will be created
You are not allowed to import any module

8. Simple delete by key
Write a function that deletes a key in a dictionary.

Prototype: def simple delete(a dictionary, key=""):
key argument will be always a string
If a key doesn’t exist, the dictionary won’t change
You are not allowed to import any module

9. Multiply by 2
Write a function that returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2

Prototype: def multiply by 2(a dictionary):
You can assume that all values are only integers
Returns a new dictionary
You are not allowed to import any module

10. Best score
Write a function that returns a key with the biggest integer value.

Prototype: def best score(a dictionary):
You can assume that all values are only integers
If no score found, return None
You can assume all students have a different score
You are not allowed to import any module

11. Multiply by using map
Write a function that returns a list with all values multiplied by a number without using any loops.

Prototype: def multiply list map(my list=[], number=0):
Returns a new list:
Same length as my list
Each value should be multiplied by number
Initial list should not be modified
You are not allowed to import any module
You have to use map
Your file should be max 3 lines

12. Roman to Integer
Technical interview preparation:

You are not allowed to google anything
Whiteboard first
Create a function def roman to int(roman string): that converts a Roman numeral to an integer.

You can assume the number will be between 1 to 3999.
def roman to int(roman string) must return an integer
If the roman string is not a string or None, return 0
